# Guidelines
- Fork or clone the GIT rep
- Build out the designed form that's in /design/form-challenge.png
- Allowed libraries/plugins:
	- Modernizr
	- jQuery
	- jQuery Validation (or any JS validation plugin)
- Make sure you're not loading in resources you don't need
- Use HTML 5 validation that fallsback to JS validation, which falls back to PHP validation (you don't have to build the PHP validation)
- Make sure the form is naturally keyboard accessible
- Use semantic HTML
